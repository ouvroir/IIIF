#### Description :

- founding institutions & contributors :

  - [Mnemoscene](https://mnemoscene.io/), Email : hello@mnemoscene

- Objectives :

  - Promote learning and engagement with online digital collections
  - It was initiated to meet the online teaching needs
  - To present collection in visual storytelling form

- More :

  - Exhibit is built with the [Universal Viewer](https://universalviewer.io/), a leading IIIF viewer for images, 3D models, PDFs and audiovisual content. The Exhibit project is maintained by the Universal Viewer Steering Group through the donations of its members.

- Main Features :

  - We can import multiple images
  - Has 4 standard template slides, scroll, quiz and kiosk (scroll is good among all).
  - We can give password protection and even we can embed this in other websites in .html file
  - Exhibit supports high resolution images up to thousands of pixels on each side. Using IIIF, images are broken into tiles, which enables browsers to efficiently load only the data needed to display a given zoom level.
  - Exhibit supports 3D models in glb/glTF format via IIIF.
  - We can add annotations, it can be bolded text, italic, hyperlinked text, bullet points, etc. We can also provide background colour. Annotations will appear on the left top side.

- Limitations :

  - It's just a visual storytelling tool, we can’t customise more than those 4 standard templates. It's not a library or something which we can code.
  - If we add a single image and try to provide annotations for different parts of the image while we zoom in, then the quality of the image becomes less or it doesn’t look more clear.
  - If we add multiple images, like the main image and while we zoom in, if we add the zoom-in part of the image separately then the transition will not be smooth.
