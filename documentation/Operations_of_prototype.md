## Vocabulary 

- Image
- Items
- Notices

## Description

Explanations of the different operations that can be performed by the user. This concerns the visualization of items, the reading of notices 
or the comparison between these elements.

### Objectives

Non-exhaustive list of what could be put in place for the prototype. (Highlighting) of the elements that we want to see appear 
and those which seem secondary for the first prototype.

### Average use case

The use of these operations is to be defined according to the users of the project. Some operations will target certain profiles while others will not
It is necessary to define the target audiences and the corresponding operations.

### Roadmap and future developement

Link the operations with the different Images APIs, see what can be improved, used, created and the concerns 
of using certain operations

## Operation

### Image 

- Move the image in all directions.
- High definition zoom on each part of the image.

### Items

- Zoom 

*When I click on the item I can zoom in on it.*

- Full screen ([V&A Ocean Liners](https://canvas-panel.digirati.com/#/examples/oceanliners?manifest=https://stephenwf.github.io/ocean-liners.json))

*Thanks to a button, put the image in full screen and let appear a menu with 
the available tools. Button with a cross to go back.*

- Highlight/blur

*The background image is blurred and in black and white, so our item is put forward.*

- Layout of items

*When I have selected my item and the text box appears, 
the item must be enlarged (always with this color difference between the background and the item).*

- Items annotation

*When the mouse passes over the item, its title appears.*

*When I click on the item, the corresponding text box appears.*

- Nav bar ([Sleep Stories](http://ghp.wellcomecollection.org/annotation-viewer/quilt/#2))

*Ability to move from item to item with a navigation bar.*

- Delete the text from the image ([Sleep Stories](http://ghp.wellcomecollection.org/annotation-viewer/quilt/#2))

*Possibility to zoom in on the item while removing the "explanatory text" for better observation.*

### Text area

- Scroll

*Display the whole text area or a part of it with the possibility to scroll.*

- Layout of the text area

*Be able to choose the location of the text area according to the item area 
of the item area (if item on the right of the image then text on the left).*

- Texts annotations

    - Item title 

*Make the title of the item (notice) appear first in the text box.*

    - Numerisation

*Area dedicated to the scanned.*

    - Transcription

*Area dedicated to the scanned (page).*

    - Translation

*Next to the transcription, show the translation of the text.*

    - Notice

*The area of the notice is below the previous elements, the notice does not appear entirely
you must be able to scroll.*

### Links items - texts

- Compare

*Possibility to compare two (or more) items with each other with their records.*

- Navigate between items through the records

*If a record refers to another item, you can click to display the item (and) its corresponding record.*

### Research

- Search for items by keywords 

*This operation is useful if the user returns to the site several times and (works/studies/interested) in particular items.*
